# IsMardiGrasEarly.com

A single-page website that answers the age-old New Orleans question: is Mardi Gras early this year?

## What it does

The site detects the next upcoming Mardi Gras, classifies it using four different systems, and lets users explore any year they want.

## Design

**Colors:** Purple, green, and gold (traditional Mardi Gras colors). Should feel festive but tasteful. Think refined, not Bourbon Street gift shop. Good contrast, accessible.

**Layout:** Single page, centered content, clean typography. Mobile-friendly.

**Tone:** Fun but not goofy. A well-made silly thing.

## Core sections

### 1. Hero / Year selector

The selected year's Mardi Gras date displayed large and prominent. Default to the next upcoming Mardi Gras (if today is January 5, 2026, show 2026).

Users can change the year by:
- Typing directly into the year (editable number)
- Or increment/decrement buttons
- Or a dropdown

Make it obvious this is interactive.

### 2. The verdict

For the selected year, show the classification across all four systems:

| System | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Halves | Early / Late |
| Thirds | Early / Kinda in the Middle / Late |
| Fourths | Very Early / Early / Late / Very Late |
| Mood | Blink and you'll miss it / Plenty of time / Endless Carnival / Are we still doing this? |

The Mood should feel like the "real" answer. Maybe larger or more prominent.

### 3. The full breakdown table

Show all 36 possible Mardi Gras dates with their classifications:

| # | Date | Halves | Thirds | Fourths | Mood |
|---|------|--------|--------|---------|------|
| 1 | Feb. 3 | Early | Early | Very Early | Blink and you'll miss it |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 36 | Mar. 9 | Late | Late | Very Late | Are we still doing this? |

Highlight the row matching the selected year's date. The highlight should be visually obvious (background color, border, something).

### 4. Next 50 years

A table showing the next 50 Mardi Gras dates (starting from current year) with their verdicts:

| Year | Date | Fourths | Mood |
|------|------|---------|------|
| 2026 | Feb. 17 | Early | Plenty of time |
| 2027 | Feb. 9 | Very Early | Blink and you'll miss it |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Clicking a row (or the year) should update the main hero/verdict section to that year.

### 5. Summary of next 50

A small summary table or visualization showing the distribution:

| Mood | Count |
|------|-------|
| Blink and you'll miss it | 12 |
| Plenty of time | 14 |
| Endless Carnival | 15 |
| Are we still doing this? | 9 |

Or a simple bar chart. Something to give a sense of "how often do we get each type?"

## Technical notes

**Calculating Mardi Gras:** Easter follows the Computus algorithm. Mardi Gras is always 47 days before Easter Sunday. There are JavaScript libraries for this, or the formula can be implemented directly.

**Classification logic:**

Halves (18 days each):
- Early: Feb 3–20
- Late: Feb 21–Mar 9

Thirds (12 days each):
- Early: Feb 3–14
- Kinda in the Middle: Feb 15–26
- Late: Feb 27–Mar 9

Fourths (9 days each):
- Very Early: Feb 3–11
- Early: Feb 12–20
- Late: Feb 21–Mar 1
- Very Late: Mar 2–9

Mood (same as Fourths):
- Blink and you'll miss it: Feb 3–11
- Plenty of time: Feb 12–20
- Endless Carnival: Feb 21–Mar 1
- Are we still doing this?: Mar 2–9

**No backend required.** All calculations happen client-side.

## Hosting & deployment

**Repository:** Public GitHub repo (e.g., `andrewedunn/is-mardi-gras-early`)

**Hosting:** Netlify, deployed from the GitHub repo. Or github pages with a custom domain.

**Domain:** ismardigrasearly.com

## Out of scope

- User accounts
- Sharing/social features
- Historical Mardi Gras data (pre-2026)
- Multiple cities (New Orleans only)
- Parade schedules or other Carnival info

## Success

Someone in New Orleans can pull this up on their phone during a January conversation, type in the year, and settle the question with authority.
